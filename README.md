Weighted Undirected Graphs and Minimum Spanning Trees. Kruskal’s Algorithm for Minimum Spanning Trees.

An application that combines a variety of data structures and algorithms, implementing a well-encapsulated ADT called WUGraph in a package called graph and implement Kruskal’s algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph, in a package called graphalg.

A WUGraph represents a weighted, undirected graph in which self-edges are
permitted. For maximum speed, it stores edges in two data structures: unordered doubly-linked adjacency lists and a hash table.

Minimum spanning trees, and Kruskal’s algorithm are embodied in a static method called
minSpanTree() in a class called Kruskal in a package called graphalg. Must not violate the encapsulation of the WUGraph ADT.
