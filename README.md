An application which combines a variety of data structures and algorithms, implementing a well-encapsulated ADT and implement Kruskal’s algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph.

A WUGraph represents a weighted, undirected graph in which self-edges are
permitted. For maximum speed, it stores edges in two data structures: unordered doubly-linked adjacency lists and a hash table. Kruskal’s algorithm are embodied in a static method. (Must not violate the encapsulation of the WUGraph ADT)
