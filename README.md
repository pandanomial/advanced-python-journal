### Weighted Undirected Graphs and Minimum Spanning Trees. Kruskal’s Algorithm for Minimum Spanning Trees.

### An application that combines a variety of data structures and algorithms, implementing a well-encapsulated ADT called WUGraph in a package called graph and implement Kruskal’s algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph, in a package called graphalg.

A WUGraph represents a weighted, undirected graph in which self-edges are
permitted. For maximum speed, it stores edges in two data structures: unordered doubly-linked adjacency lists and a hash table.
